        <p><i><b>For Dr. Steven Gold, a single patient may unearth the truth behind a murder—and himself.</b></i></p> 
        <p></p>
        <p><i><b>A Question of Balance</b> is a cerebral and emotionally charged mystery that examines the fragile terrain of guilt, belief, and the cost of self-knowledge.</i></p>        
        <p>...</p>
        <p>
          <i><b>A Question of Balance</i></b> is a philosophical psychological murder mystery exploring the unraveling mind of therapist Steven Gold after an enigmatic new patient reveals unsettling truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blending the taut intensity of a therapy thriller with the layered depth of literary fiction and the moral complexity of a murder investigation, the novel follows Dr. Steven Gold, a seasoned psychotherapist who prides himself on rationality and control—until a new patient walks through his door. Samael Light is articulate, self-assured, and disturbingly perceptive. What begins as an unusual case quickly becomes something far more personal, as Light begins unearthing truths Gold has long buried.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a respected rabbi is discovered murdered—his body posed in a crucifixion—Gold is drawn into the investigation. His connection to the victim is hazy, but troubling. And as the sessions with Light deepen, Gold finds himself caught in a tightening web of memory, guilt, and suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
          With echoes of <i>The Silent Patient</i> and <i>The Secret History</i>, <i><b>A Question of Balance</i></b> explores the fragile boundary between analysis and obsession—and how even a mind trained to heal can lose sight of itself.
